= System Properties Overview

This section provides an overview of the key system properties that can be configured to modify the behavior of the application.

NOTE: All boolean properties listed in the table are read using https://javadoc.io/static/net.openhft/chronicle-core/2.23ea13/net/openhft/chronicle/core/Jvm.html#getBoolean-java.lang.String-[`net.openhft.chronicle.core.Jvm.getBoolean(java.lang.String)`]method. A property is considered enabled if it is set using `-Dflag`, `-Dflag=true`, or `-Dflag=yes`.

|===
| Property Key | Default Value | Description | Java Variable Name (Type)
| `background.releaser` | `true` | Turn off the BackgroundResourceReleaser thread to manage resource releasing in your own thread | `BG_RELEASER` (boolean)
| `chronicle.announcer.disable` | `false` | If enabled, disables the InternalAnnouncer | `DISABLE_ANNOUNCEMENT` (boolean)
| `debug` | `false` | Returns if the JVM is running in debug mode | `IS_DEBUG` (boolean)
| `disable.discard.warning` | `true` | Called from finalise() implementations. If `false`, message is displayed stating that resource cannot be closed, and IllegalStateException is thrown  | `DISABLE_DISCARD_WARNING` (boolean)
| `disable.perf.info` | `false` | if enabled, returns NullExceptionHandler | `disablePerfInfo` (boolean)
| `disable.resource.warning` | `false` | If enabled, returns that resource tracing is turned on | boolean
| `disable.single.threaded.check` | `false` | Disables thread safety checks | boolean
| `jfr` | `false` | Returns if the JVM is running in flight recorder mode | `IS_FLIGHT_RECORDER` (boolean)
| `jvm.resources.tracing` | `false` | Returns if certain chronicle resources (such as memory regions) are traced. Reference counting can be enabled, which incurs slightly less performance, but it provides a means of detecting proper release of resources | RESOURCE_TRACING (boolean)
| `jvm.safepoint.enabled` | `false` | If enabled, inserts a low-cost Java safe-point, which can help to find blockages. Jvm.safepoint can also be added when monitoring the event loop in link:https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Threads#monitoring-the-event-loop[Chronicle-Threads] to help identify hotspots in the code | `SAFEPOINT_ENABLED` (boolean)
| `reference.warn.count` | unknown | If there is a high reserve count (relative to referenceCounted), warning is thrown stating the referenceName with the high reserve count | `WARN_COUNT` (int)
| `reference.warn.secs` | 0.003 | If time of inThreadPerformanceRelease is greater than default, message is thrown to state the ms it takes to performRelease | `WARN_NS` (long)
| `report.unoptimised` | `false` | If enabled, reports usage of unoptimised method | `REPORT_UNOPTIMISED` (boolean)
| `warnAndCloseIfNotClosed` | `true` |If 'false', returns the DEBUG exception handler, which prints as System.out or DEBUG level logging | boolean
